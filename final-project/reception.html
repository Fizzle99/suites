       <h3>Catering</h3> 
       In-house catering is affordable and delicious, prepared by our many chefs with a sprawling menu of delicacies to enjoy. We provide meals at the following timeslots: <br> <br>

       <h4>Day</h4> 
       -8:00 AM to 4:00 PM <br> <br>
       <h4>Evening</h4> 
       -5:00 PM to 11:00 PM<br> <br>

       If our menu isn't to your taste, there are several restaurants near each hotel site from which you can order catering. However, hosting outside services will have a small fee of $25.00.
